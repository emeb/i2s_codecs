# CODEC PMODS
This directory contains KiCAD designs for various CODEC PMOD breakout boards. The
following boards have been built and tested:
* WM8731 - this is an earlier design found in an [older repository](https://github.com/emeb/Old_Website/tree/main/synth/codec_pmod).
It's a venerable codec that's been used in a lot of computers and media players as well as
add-on boards for the Raspberry Pi but now it's obsolete.
* TLV320AIC3101 - this is a currently available (as of 2025) codec that has some interesting
peculiarities that may make it unsuitable for some applications.
* NAU88C22 - this is an inexpensive codec with a lot of interesting features that seems to
perform reasonably well.
* SGTL5000 - this one has been around for a while and is still available. It's notable for its
small size.
* UDA1345 - This is a long obsolete part that I included just because I had a few in my
parts inventory that I'd never tried out. It's idiosyncratic.
